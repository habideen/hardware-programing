This tutorial uses arduino uno board with 16 MHz crystal
========================================================

Get an arduino board with bootloader (Call this board A)

Find another arduino board to place the Atmega328p that does have bootloader and insert it into it (Call this board B)
Or
If you don't have another Arduino board use the schematic on https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/ArduinoToBreadboard for connection.


Connection 
----------

Board A        Board B
-------        -------

PIN 13 ------> PIN 13

PIN 12 ------> PIN 12

PIN 11 ------> PIN 11

PIN 10 ------> RESET PIN

GND ---------> GND

5V ----------> 5V


Connect connect USB to board A

Make sure you have selected the current Arduino board COM Port in Tools -> COM Port

Goto File -> Preferences
Paste the URL below in 'Additional Board URL' input field
https://mcudude.github.io/MiniCore/package_MCUdude_MiniCore_index.json
Click OK

Goto Tools -> Board -> 'Board Manager' 
Make sure you are connected to the internet
Type minicore in the search box then install it
Closs this istallation dialog once installed.

Open File -> Examples -> ArduinoISP -> ArduinoISP
Click Upload button and wait for Done Uploading below the IDE


Select Tools -> Board -> Atmega328 (This is down the menu. It is installed by the minicore)

Select Tools -> Programmer -> Arduino as ISP

Make sure that 16MHz is selected under Tools -> Clock

Click on Tools -> Burn Bootloader
Wait for the success message


Change back to Tools -> Board -> Arduino Uno
Change back to Tools -> Programmer -> AVR ISP

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You are done with the bootloader setup

Upload a blink example to confirm the bootloader setup

Thanks.
